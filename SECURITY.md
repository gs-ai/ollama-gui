## Action Required

### For Existing Installations

If you have already installed the Ollama GUI Command Center, please update your dependencies:

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Update dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

# Restart the backend
cd backend
python main.py
```

### For New Installations

No action required - the updated requirements.txt will install patched versions automatically.

---

## Verification

After updating, verify the installed versions:

```bash
pip list | grep -E "aiohttp|fastapi|Pillow|python-multipart"
```

Expected output:
```
aiohttp           3.13.3
fastapi           0.109.1
Pillow            12.1.1
python-multipart  0.0.22
```

## Security Best Practices

### Going Forward

1. **Regular Updates**: Check for dependency updates monthly
2. **Security Scanning**: Use tools like `pip-audit` or `safety`
3. **Version Pinning**: Keep dependencies pinned to specific versions
4. **Testing**: Test updates in development before production

### Recommended Security Tools

```bash
# Install security audit tools
pip install pip-audit safety

# Run security audit
pip-audit
safety check

# Check for outdated packages
pip list --outdated
```
